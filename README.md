### Hi there 👋

#### 🌱 I hvae learned ... Big data analysis class from Multi-Campus
Everything was so new to me, but progressing is what I really pursue. Who knows I'll be a great developer one day? 💁


#### 💬 Ask me about Math! I've been working as a math teacher so far. I like teaching as well as learning. 😊 Math was my favorite subject when I was a teenager. Well, data is formed by zeros and ones too, isn't it interesting? 🤦🏻
